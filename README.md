## 🔥 News
* **2026-01-26**: Our paper has been accepted by ICLR 2026. 🎉🎉🎉
* **2025-03-27**: Add HuggingFace integration to ARPG.
* **2025-03-25**: Add the sampling arccos schedule.
* **2025-03-14**: The paper and code are released!


## 📖 Introduction
We introduce a novel autoregressive image generation framework named **ARPG**. This framework is capable of conducting **BERT-style masked modeling** by employing a **GPT-style causal architecture**. Consequently, it is able to generate images in parallel following a random token order and also provides support for the KV cache. 
* 💪 **ARPG** achieves an FID of **1.94**
* 🚀 **ARPG** delivers throughput **26 times faster** than [LlamaGen](https://github.com/FoundationVision/LlamaGen)—nearly matching [VAR](https://github.com/FoundationVision/VAR)
* ♻️ **ARPG** reducing memory consumption by over **75%** compared to [VAR](https://github.com/FoundationVision/VAR).
* 🔍 **ARPG** supports **zero-shot inference** (e.g., inpainting and outpainting).
* 🛠️ **ARPG** can be easily extended to **controllable generation**.


## 🤗 Model Zoo
We provide the model weights pre-trained on ImageNet-1K 256*256.
| Model | Param | Schedule | CFG | Step | FID | IS | Weight |

## 🎮 Quick Start
You can easily play ARPG using the HuggingFace ``DiffusionPipeline``.
```python
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline

pipeline = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("hp-l33/ARPG", custom_pipeline="hp-l33/ARPG")

class_labels = [207, 360, 388, 113, 355, 980, 323, 979]

generated_image = pipeline(
    model_type="ARPG-XL",       # choose from 'ARPG-L', 'ARPG-XL', or 'ARPG-XXL'
    seed=0,                     # set a seed for reproducibility
    num_steps=64,               # number of autoregressive steps
    class_labels=class_labels,  # provide valid ImageNet class labels
    cfg_scale=4,                # classifier-free guidance scale
    output_dir="./images",      # directory to save generated images
    cfg_schedule="constant",    # choose between 'constant' (suggested) and 'linear'
    sample_schedule="arccos",   # choose between 'arccos' (suggested) and 'cosine'
)

generated_image.show()
```
If you want to train or reproduce the results of ARPG, please refer to [Getting Started](GETTING_STARTED.md).
